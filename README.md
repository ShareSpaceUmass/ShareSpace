# ShareSpace
## About
ShareSpace intends to be a  central  app  where  more  preferences are taken into consideration to upgrade the campus housing experience. We intend to work in tandem with UMass Housing to provide suitable matches for the students while adhering to university housing policies. The app will allow students to input their preferences in the form of an interactive survey and help connect them to students with matching interests, lifestyle choices. The connected students will then be able to interact with each other and decide whether they would like room together in the following semester. We believe that this can be used to mitigate difficult situations that might arise between students with heavily opposite beliefs and interests and in turn improve the overall mental health of the student body.
